# Sunday 10 test practising quetions.

---

`1.`Write a code to take time in seconds and convert it into hour, mins and seonds.

- Eg:

input:
5000

---

`2.`Write a code to take temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it to Celsius.

C=(F-32)\*5/9

---

`3.`Take a number and find the "ans" by sum of sqaure of digits. once you find this "ans" repeat the steps ( I mean find sum of square of digits of ans) and repeat this process until you get 1.

Eg: 49 => 44 + 99 =>16+81 => 97
since 97 is not equal to 1 so we will repeat the steps
97 => 99+77 = 81+49 = 130
it is still not 1: so lets repeat
130 => 11 + 33 + 0 => 10 it is still not 1: so lets repeat
10 => 1\*1 +0 = 1

If after certain number of steps finally we get 1 than number is called "CodeSpecial"

in case if it is not possible to get 1 after any number of steps than lets call that number "SomethingUnusual"
